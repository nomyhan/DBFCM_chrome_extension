WHAT IS A SIDE PANEL?
=====================

A side panel is a docked panel that opens on the right side of your browser
window. Unlike a popup that disappears when you click elsewhere, the side
panel stays open and visible while you browse.

BENEFITS OF SIDE PANEL:
=======================

✓ Stays open while browsing
✓ View waitlist while working in LiveAccess
✓ No need to keep reopening
✓ Resizable width (drag the left edge)
✓ Full-height display
✓ Perfect for multi-tasking
✓ Always accessible when needed

HOW IT WORKS:
=============

1. Click the extension icon (paw print) in your toolbar
2. Side panel slides out from the right side
3. Shows full waitlist with all information
4. Panel stays open while you browse other tabs
5. Click extension icon again to close panel

3. View waitlist in side panel
4. Click appointment in side panel

ADVANTAGES OVER POPUP:
======================

Popup (Old Way):
  ✗ Closes when clicking elsewhere
  ✗ Must reopen constantly
  ✗ Fixed small size
  ✗ Interrupts workflow
  ✗ Can't see while working

Side Panel (New Way):

  ✓ Resizable width
  ✓ Parallel workflow

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
===================

Chrome/Edge doesn't have default shortcuts for side panels, but you can:

1. Go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts
2. Find "WKennel7 Waitlist Viewer"
3. Set a custom keyboard shortcut
4. Example: Ctrl+Shift+W

Then press your shortcut to toggle the side panel!

MULTI-MONITOR SETUP:
====================

Works great with multiple monitors:

Option 1: Browser on one monitor, side panel visible
Option 2: Move LiveAccess tab to second monitor, keep waitlist on first
Option 3: Drag browser window to span monitors for extra wide view

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Panel won't open:
  → Check if browser supports side panels (Chrome 114+, Edge 114+)
  → Reload extension
  → Try restarting browser

Panel appears but is blank:
  → Check backend server is running
  → Check settings (⚙️) for correct URLs
  → Click 🔄 to refresh

Panel is too narrow/wide:
  → Drag left edge to resize
  → Browser remembers your preference

Can't close panel:
  → Click extension icon again
  → Or click the X in panel header (if available)
  → Or reload the page

2. Use ⚙️ settings to customize URLs
3. Resize panel to your preferred width

COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVES:
===========================

vs. Separate Window:
  ✓ Integrated into browser
  ✓ Moves with browser window
  ✓ Easier to manage

vs. Popup:

2. Resize panel to ~400-500px width
