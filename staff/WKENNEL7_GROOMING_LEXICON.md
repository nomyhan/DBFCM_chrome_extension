## I. DOG GROOMING CLIPPER BLADE TERMINOLOGY

### **CRITICAL**: Dog Grooming vs. Human Hair Clipper Numbering

**Dog grooming clipper blades follow a REVERSE numbering system from human hair clippers:**
- **LOWER numbers = LONGER hair length**  
- **HIGHER numbers = SHORTER hair length**

### Standard Dog Grooming Blade Lengths (by usage frequency)

#### Primary Blades with Correct Measurements
- **#2** (3,307 uses) - Approximately 1/2" (12mm) length
- **#1** (2,747 uses) - Approximately 3/4" (19mm) length  
- **#2dd** (2,268 uses) - Shorter/tighter than standard #2
- **#0** (1,812 uses) - Longest standard blade, approximately 1" length
- **#1dd** (1,568 uses) - Shorter/tighter than standard #1
- **#0dd** (1,444 uses) - Shorter/tighter than standard #0
- **#5** (1,321 uses) - 1/4" (6mm) length
- **#7** (1,285 uses) - 1/8" (3.2mm) length
- **#00** (1,268 uses) - Very close cut, shorter than #0
- **#10** (371 uses) - Very short, 1/16" (2mm) - used for sanitary areas

#### Complete Dog Grooming Blade Chart
```
Blade #    Length      Millimeters    Common Use
#0         ~1"         ~25mm         Longest cut
#1         ~3/4"       ~19mm         Long body work  
#2         ~1/2"       ~12mm         Medium body work
#3         1/2"        13mm          Versatile length
#4         3/8"        9.5mm         Medium-short
#5         1/4"        6mm           Short body work
#7         1/8"        3.2mm         Detail work
#10        1/16"       2mm           Sanitary areas
#30        ~0.02"      0.5mm         Very close
#40        ~0.01"      0.3mm         Closest cut
```

#### Specialized Lengths & Modifiers
- **#Add** (483 uses) - Custom between-size blade
- **#4** (589 uses) - 3/8" (9.5mm) for medium cuts
- **#4dd** (200 uses) - Shorter/tighter than standard #4

### Critical "dd" Understanding

**Analysis of WKennel7 usage patterns confirms:**

- **"dd" indicates a shorter/tighter cut** than the corresponding standard numbered blade
- **Evidence from descriptions:**
  - "Owner said #2 is too short" → next appointment uses #2dd
  - "#2dd all over...#2 on cheeks" (different lengths on same pet)
  - "#1dd body (#2 in matted areas)" (tighter cut for normal coat, regular for mats)

#### Technique Modifiers
- **dd** = Shorter/tighter than standard blade number
- **against** = Clipping against hair growth (shorter result)
- **with** = Clipping with hair growth (leaves ~one blade length longer)

## V. STANDARDIZATION GUIDELINES

### Terminology Consistency

#### Preferred Terms
- **"teddybear"** (single word) over "teddy bear"
- **"handstrip"** (single word) over "hand strip"
- **Specific blade numbers** (#2dd, #1dd) with proper dd notation
- **Anatomical precision** (muzzle vs mouth, topknot vs head)

#### Documentation Standards
**Recommended Format (Date/Groomer now in database fields):**
```
[BODY WORK], [FACE WORK], [DETAILS], [SPECIAL NOTES]. (Service Code) $Price
```

**Legacy Format (still in use):**
```
Date: Groomer: [clipper work], [scissor work], [special notes]. (Service Code) $Price
```

**Note:** Date and Groomer information is now captured in GLDate and GLGroomerID database fields, making inclusion in description text redundant. Price field inclusion serves as verification against invoice data, though mismatches can cause confusion.

#### Blade Usage Guidelines
- **Remember: Lower numbers = longer hair** (opposite of human clippers)
- **Use "dd" notation** when shorter than standard blade needed
- **Specify direction** (against/with grain) when relevant

## VII. IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Groomers
1. **Use correct dog grooming blade terminology** - remember lower numbers = longer hair
2. **Document blade reasoning** (client preference, coat condition)
3. **Note behavioral observations** for safety and future reference
4. **Specify medical accommodations** clearly

### For Schedulers
1. **Match blade preferences** from previous appointments
2. **Flag behavioral concerns** during booking
3. **Allow extra time** for difficult handling cases

### For Training
1. **Teach dog grooming blade numbering** - opposite of human clippers
2. **Emphasize dd blade concept** - shorter than standard number
3. **Practice consistent documentation** using established patterns
4. **Review behavioral indicators** for safety protocols
