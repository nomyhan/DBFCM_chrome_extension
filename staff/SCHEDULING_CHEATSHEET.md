# Scheduling Cheatsheet

**Hours:** Tue-Sat 8:30am-5:30pm | **Closed:** Sun, Mon, New Year's, July 4th, Thanksgiving, Christmas

## Time Slots
| Slot | Use |
|------|-----|
| 8:30 | Full svc, handstrip. Bath-only OK if Elmer has gap |
| 10:00 | Full svc |
| 11:30 | Full svc |
| 1:30 | Full svc or bath-only (preferred for bath-only) |
| 2:30 | Reserve slot (not online). All dogs in by 2:30 |

## Groomers
| Who | Handstrip | Notes |
|-----|:---------:|-------|
| Tomoko | ✗ | Any breed, prefers not LG/XL |
| Kumi | ✓ | ONLY handstrip groomer, prefers not LG/XL |
| Mandilyn | ✗ | Default for new clients, no-preference, LG/XL |

**Priority:** Client preference → LG/XL to Mandilyn → New/no-pref to Mandilyn → # breeds to Kumi

**New LG/XL:** Clear with groomer first. May decline (e.g., Samoyeds).

## Bather (Elmer)
- Cycles multiple dogs — overlapping assignments OK
- 2+ dogs same slot for different groomers → may overload, use judgment
- When out: Use Guest Groomer or groomers bathe own dogs

## Duration (Calendar shows 90 min — actual times differ)
| Size | Actual Total | | Size | Actual Total |
|------|--------------|---|------|--------------|
| XS/SM | ~2 hr | | MD/LG | 2.5-3 hr |
| XL | Case by case | | Fancy | Up to 4 hr |

**Tell clients:** Allow up to 4 hours

## Pet Markers
**#** = Handstrip → Kumi only | ***** = Show dog → Tomoko/Kumi preferred

## Multi-Pet
- No preference → same slot, different groomers (parallel)
- Preference or 1 groomer → same groomer, 180 min (verify both slots open)

## Before Booking
1. Check PtGroom (grooming notes) & CLWarning (client issues)
2. Check blocked time (paper calendar at desk easier than GUI)
3. Confirm groomer can handle the breed

## Online Booking Fixes
- **Off-time appt (9:00, 10:30):** Add "Do Not Book" before it OR extend previous appt's out-time
- **Groomers bathing own dogs:** Adjust out-times — no overlap possible
- Out-times are internal only (clients see drop-off time only)

## Escalate
New clients • Pricing • Complaints • Fully booked requests • Payments/refunds • Wrong groomer match
