## Phone & Customer Communication

### Answering the Phone

**Greeting:**
> "Dog's Best Friend. This is [your name]. How may I help you?"

**First question after greeting:**
> "Have you been with us before?"

This determines your next steps (new vs existing customer flow).

---

### New Customer Call Flow

#### Step 1: Identify the Pet
> "What kind of dog do you have?"

**Why this matters:**
- **Breed** = determines which groomer can handle it
- **Size** = affects pricing and feasibility

#### Step 2: Collect Customer Information
- First and last name
- Phone number (confirm it's text-capable)
- Email address
- City (for records)

#### Step 3: Collect Pet Information
- Pet name
- Breed
- Weight (approximate)
- Age or birthdate
- Vet name (optional but helpful)

#### Step 4: Vaccination Check
> "Is [pet name] up to date on shots?"

- We require rabies vaccination
- Generally trust the customer's word
- Accept documentation if offered

#### Step 5: Special Situations to Identify

**Senior Dogs (10+ years):**
- $25 advanced age/special handling charge
- Liability waiver required
- Tell them during the call
- If asked why: "It's shop policy"

**Puppies (under 1 year):**
- 20% off first appointment
- Must have vaccinations complete

**Extra Large Dogs (Samoyeds, Great Danes, etc.):**
- Quote high price upfront (natural filter - many will say "I'll call back")
- Only Mandilyn takes XL dogs
- Some breeds she won't do (Samoyeds, etc.)
- Must check her willingness BEFORE booking
- Needs extra time in schedule

**Behavioral Concerns:**
- $25 special handling charge if significant issues
- Note in pet record

#### Step 6: Schedule the Appointment
- Default to Mandilyn's schedule for new clients
- Special breeds needing expertise → Tomoko or Kumi
- Present ONE option at a time
- Small/medium dogs typically 8:30 AM

#### Step 7: Confirm
> "Okay, you're all set for [day], [date] at [time]. We'll see you then. Please bring proof of rabies vaccination to your first appointment."

---

### Existing Customer Call Flow

#### Step 1: Look Up the Customer
- Use caller ID to pull up their record
- Check during greeting if possible

#### Step 2: Anticipate Their Need
Look at their account:
- Last appointment date
- Upcoming appointment (if any)
- Multi-pet household?

Most calls are: booking, canceling, or rescheduling.

#### Step 3: Multi-Pet Households
- Assume ALL pets are coming unless they say otherwise
- Ask: "Will we be seeing [Pet 1] and [Pet 2] together?"

#### Step 4: Handle Their Request
- See Scheduling section for booking
- See Cancellation section for cancels
- See Rescheduling section for changes

---

### Handling Cancellations

**Collect:**
1. Customer name (confirm from caller ID)
2. Pet name
3. Appointment date (verify in system)

**Ask:**
> "Would you like to reschedule for a different day, or just cancel for now?"

**If just canceling:**
> "Okay, I've canceled your appointment. Give us a call when you're ready to reschedule."

**If rescheduling:**
Continue to rescheduling flow.

**Policy notes:**
- We appreciate as much notice as possible
- 48-hour cancellation policy exists but rarely enforced
- Note patterns of frequent cancellations

---

### Price Quotes

**Rule: Don't volunteer pricing unless asked.**

Many online customers already know our prices.

**If asked:**
- Get breed and weight first
- Look up pricing for that size/coat type
- Quote the price

**For XL dogs:**
- Quote high (intentional filter)
- Many will say "I'll call back" - that's fine

---

### Dealing with Difficult Situations

**Customer insists on unavailable time:**
> "Unfortunately we're fully booked at that time. I can offer [alternative] or put you on our waitlist and call you if something opens up."

**Customer is upset:**
- Stay calm and professional
- Apologize for the inconvenience
- Offer solutions
- If escalating, get manager: "Let me get my manager to help with this."

**Graceful decline (for dogs we can't take):**
> "I'm sorry, we're not able to accommodate [breed/size] at this time. I'd recommend checking with [other groomer/shop] who may be better equipped for your dog."

---

## Appointment Scheduling

### Groomer Assignment Rules

**Category 1: Specific Groomer Required**
- Check pet/client warning fields
- Some clients MUST have a specific groomer
- Never switch without manager approval

**Category 2: Prefers Groomer but Flexible on Time**
> "Unfortunately [preferred groomer] is fully booked that day, but [other groomer] has an opening at [time]. Would you like to take that, or wait for [preferred groomer]?"

Give them the choice.

**Category 3: Flexible (No Preference)**
- Any groomer works
- Find the best available opening
- Default new clients to Mandilyn

### Time Slot Selection

| Slot | Best For |
|------|----------|
| 8:30 | Full service, handstrip, SM/MD dogs |
| 10:00 | Full service |
| 11:30 | Full service |
| 1:30 | Full service or bath-only |
| 2:30 | Reserve slot - manager use only |

**Bath-only timing:**
- Preferred: 1:30 or 2:30 (doesn't hold up baths for groomers)
- 8:30 exception: OK when Elmer has a gap (Tomoko has small dog, Kumi has handstrip, Mandilyn does her own first)

**Goal:** All dogs in by 2:30.

### Booking Timeline

- **Normal:** 4-6 weeks out
- **Policy maximum:** 120 days advance
- **Steady customers:** Can book full year, auto-assign preferred groomer

**Complications to watch for:**
- Kumi at dog shows (check blocked time)
- Tomoko in Japan (seasonal)
- Vacation schedules

### ASAP Requests
1. Check current week for holes (any groomer)
2. Then next week
3. Then next available

### Specific Day/Time Requests
1. Search that specific slot
2. Check preferred groomer first
3. Offer alternatives if unavailable

### Rescheduling

1. Verify current appointment in system
2. Confirm which pet(s)
3. Ask for new preferred date/time
4. Select same groomer if relevant
5. Present ONE option at a time
6. Confirm new appointment

---

### Multi-Pet Household Scheduling

**No groomer preference:**
- Book same slot with DIFFERENT groomers (parallel)
- Both pets done at same time

**Has groomer preference OR only one groomer available:**
- Book both with same groomer
- Span 2 slots (180 minutes instead of 90)
- Verify BOTH slots are actually open

**Watch for online booking errors:**
Clients often book 2 dogs in one slot without realizing only one slot is actually available. Always verify.

---

### Walk-In Requests

**General rule:** Usually too busy - we're appointment-based.

**Exceptions:**

| Request | Handle |
|---------|--------|
| Nail trim only | Often can fit in (quick, doesn't need full setup) |
| Bath only | Maybe end-of-day when Elmer is less busy. NOT early when he's bathing for groomers. |
| Full service | Requires complete setup - only if actual opening exists |

---

### No-Shows and Late Arrivals

**Policy:** 30-minute grace period (late fee exists but rarely applied)

**Before 30 minutes:** Text/call to check if they're coming

**After 30-60 minutes:** Mark as no-show if unreachable

**When you reach a late customer:**
- Assess how late they are
- Check current schedule

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Not too late + not busy | Accept them |
| Too late | Politely decline, reschedule |
| Can squeeze in | Accept, but warn pickup will be end-of-day |

---

### Mistaken Appointments (Customer shows up wrong day)

1. Apologize and investigate (usually calendar mismatch)
2. Check if we can accommodate

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Fully booked | "I'm sorry, we can't fit you in today. Your appointment is actually [correct date]." |
| Have time | Accommodate them |

---

## Waitlist Management

### When to Use the Waitlist

- Customer wants something sooner than available
- Customer wants a specific date that's fully booked

### System Limitations & Workarounds

**Limitation 1: Can't waitlist same day as real appointment**
- Workaround: Use a different date

**Limitation 2: Must pick specific date, but customer wants a range**
- Workaround: Use CURRENT DATE as placeholder
- Put real request in grooming notes: "ASAP" or "wants week of X"

**Limitation 3: Can't view all waitlist at once**
- Workaround: Use the Chrome extension (queries database, shows all waitlisted appointments ordered by creation date)

### Adding to Waitlist

1. Create appointment as normal
2. Check the "Waitlist" checkbox
3. Add notes in grooming field: what they actually want
4. Appointment exists in system but not on calendar

### Processing Waitlist When Opening Available

**Step 1: Consider factors**
- Does the date match their request?
- Does the groomer match their preference?
- Can that groomer handle this dog?
- Special services needed (handstrip = Kumi + extra time)?

**Step 2: Contact via TEXT (not call)**
> "Hi, this is [name] from Dog's Best Friend. There's an opening on [date] at [time]. Would you like to take that slot?"

**Step 3: Wait for response**
- Urgent/same-day: Move on if no quick response
- Not urgent: Can wait for reply
- If already filled when they respond: "Sorry, someone else already took that slot. I'll keep you on the list."

**IMPORTANT:** Must get confirmation BEFORE booking. Unlike regular appointments, waitlist requires explicit "yes."
